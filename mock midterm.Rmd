#The time series is seasonal with higher amounts of arrivals in Q1 and Q4. The decomposition is additive. The values of the seasonal indices are 6.78 in Q1, -7.96 in Q2, -4.71 in Q3 and 5.9 in Q4. Highest seasonality in Qr1 and lowest in Q2. One of the reasons behind this seasonality is because of the weather. People will want to travel to Australia when its warm.

# The naive model is generally off by like 10,000 in either direction. Some points in the model are off by a large amount between 30 and 40 thousand.

#The accuracy is not great for the naive model. The mean average percent error is almost 12 percent. The technique does not do a good job of factoring the seasonality. It predicts the time series will be 106.54 in 1 year.
